This experiment is aimed to give intuition on the used positional metrics.
It is done by generating n scale-free graphs using a generator.
Then motif detection and positional metrics are evaluated on those graphs.

Finally, the edge swapping technique is used to create m randomized graphs
from each of the generated n scale free graphs.
On those m*n graphs we also evaluate motifs and positional metrics.

This also includes a small experiment to verify that the conversion
of a directed multi-graph to an undirected simple graph does not change
the scale free nature of the graph.
